but we are not perfect, so we need your help. We sincerely hope that we can 
combine our efforts and our thinking to make a world-class office suite. 

Tell your friends, there is an office suite named Kingsoft Office
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Kingsoft Office famous in China, but it is really not the case in the world.
We strive to let more people know about our team and our products. We hope the 
product to be able to help more people. However, we leak the ways to do it.

And Linux version requires more users to support, it is very important to us.

continue to make more works. More users support us, more resources we get.
And more resources will be better enhance our Linux version.

Every feedback is valuable. Praise can improve our working passion, criticism can
correct our shortcomings. However, to say nothing, just silence, is the most terrible.
We will live in the world of ourselves. We will make a product, a product which is hard 
to understand, a lonely art with our imagination created.
